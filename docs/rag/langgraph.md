# LangGraph: Orchestrating LLM Workflows

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a framework built to manage **LLM agents and workflows** using graph-based execution.
It extends **LangChain** by introducing a graph abstraction that allows developers to define **complex, branching, and stateful workflows** between different AI components.

## Key Features

- **Graph-based Execution**
  - Workflows are structured as a graph of nodes and edges.
  - Nodes represent tools, agents, or logic blocks.
  - Edges control the flow of decisions and next steps.
- **State Management**
  - Maintains conversation or agent state across workflow steps.
  - Useful for iterative reasoning and memory-sensitive tasks.
- **Deterministic and Reproducible**
  - Unlike free-running agents, LangGraph makes execution predictable.
  - Easy debugging and monitoring of each workflow step.

## Use Cases

- Multi-agent collaboration (different agents with specialized roles).
- Complex decision-making pipelines (branching reasoning).
- RAG pipelines where LLM selects retrieval/analysis strategies.
- Customer service bots with fallback flows.

## Example Concept

Imagine a **customer support graph**:
1. Input node receives the question.
1. Classifier node routes it as "billing" or "technical".
1. Billing node connects with payment APIs.
1. Technical node decides between FAQ retrieval or human handoff.

This forms a **dynamic support workflow** powered by LLMs.
