# LangChain: The Framework for LLM Applications

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of building **applications powered by large language models (LLMs)**.
It focuses on **chaining together multiple components** (LLMs, APIs, databases, tools) to create more powerful AI apps.

## Core Components

- **LLM Wrappers**
  - Standardizes interaction with different foundation models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, etc.).
- **Prompt Templates**
  - Reusable format strings that structure how queries are sent to LLMs.
- **Chains**
  - A sequence of steps involving models, tools, and transformations.
  - Example: User input → Retrieve documents → Summarize → Output.
- **Memory**
  - Stores context from prior interactions, enabling **conversational continuity**.
- **Agents**
  - LLM-driven components that **decide which tool or action to perform** next.
- **Tool Integration**
  - Extend capabilities with APIs (Google Search, SQL, vector stores, etc.).

## Benefits

- Accelerates prototyping of AI applications.
- Makes **retrieval, reasoning, and tool use modular**.
- Provides a large ecosystem of integrations.

## Example Applications

- Chatbots and copilots.
- RAG pipelines with vector databases.
- Multi-step reasoning agents.
- Document QA and summarization.
